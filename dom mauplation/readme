-->How Does the DOM Work?
Browser Creates the DOM:

When you load a web page, the browser reads the HTML and creates a DOM tree.

Each HTML element (like <div>, <p>, or <h1>) becomes a node in the DOM tree.

JavaScript Accesses the DOM:

JavaScript can access and manipulate the DOM using methods like document.getElementById, querySelector, innerHTML, etc.

Changes Reflect on the Page:

When you modify the DOM using JavaScript, the browser immediately updates the page to reflect those changes.



--> Difference between javascript and  document object model
JavaScript
What it is: JavaScript is a programming language.

Purpose: It is used to add interactivity, logic, and dynamic behavior to web pages.

Example: You can use JavaScript to perform calculations, handle user input, or fetch data from a server.

DOM (Document Object Model)
What it is: The DOM is a programming interface (like a bridge) that represents the structure of a web page (HTML) as a tree of objects.

Purpose: It allows JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a web page.

Example: You can use the DOM to change the text of an element, add new elements, or remove existing ones.


 -->How They Work Together
JavaScript uses the DOM to access and modify the web page.

Without the DOM, JavaScript wouldnâ€™t be able to interact with the HTML or CSS of a page.
